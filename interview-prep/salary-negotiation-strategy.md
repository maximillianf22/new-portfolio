## How to Position Your "Over-Employment" Experience

### ✅ POSITIVE FRAMING (What to Say)

**"I've been working on multiple projects simultaneously to gain diverse experience and expand my skill set. This has given me exposure to different industries (trading, fintech, AI), different tech stacks (Vue.js, React, Next.js), and different challenges. I'm now looking to consolidate this experience into a single, focused role where I can make a bigger impact."**

### ❌ AVOID SAYING

- "I'm over-employed" (sounds negative)
- "I'm working multiple jobs because they pay poorly" (sounds desperate)
- "I need more money" (too direct)

### ✅ BETTER APPROACH

**Frame it as:**
- "I've been consulting/contracting on multiple projects"
- "I've been building diverse experience across different industries"
- "I'm ready to focus on one opportunity where I can make maximum impact"
- "I'm looking for a role that values my diverse experience"

## Salary Negotiation Strategy

### 1. Research Market Rates

**For Senior Frontend Developer in LATAM (Remote US companies):**
- Entry Senior: $2,500-3,500/month
- Mid Senior: $3,500-4,500/month
- Senior/Lead: $4,500-6,000+/month

**Your target:** $3,000-4,000/month minimum (based on your experience)

### 2. Value Proposition

**What you bring:**
- 10+ years experience
- Leadership experience (led teams of 5-16 people)
- Multiple tech stacks (React, Next.js, Vue.js, TypeScript)
- AI integration experience (rare skill)
- Multiple industries (trading, fintech, e-commerce, AI)
- Storybook/documentation expertise
- Clean code practices (ESLint, Prettier)
- Migration experience (Vue 2→3, PHP→React, .NET→React)

**This is worth $3,500-4,500/month minimum!**

### 3. Salary Negotiation Script

**When asked about salary expectations:**

```
"I'm currently earning around $4,000/month across my consulting projects, 
but I'm looking to consolidate into a single focused role. 

Based on my experience:
- 10+ years in frontend development
- Leadership experience (teams of 5-16 people)
- Multiple tech stacks (React, Next.js, Vue.js)
- AI integration expertise
- Architecture and migration experience

I'm looking for a role in the $3,500-4,500/month range, 
depending on the scope and responsibilities."
```

**Key points:**
- Mention current total (shows you're not desperate)
- Frame as "consolidating" not "needing more"
- Give range, not exact number
- Tie salary to value you bring

### 4. Red Flags to Avoid

**Don't accept:**
- Less than $3,000/month (you're worth more)
- "We'll review in 6 months" (get it in writing or don't accept)
- Equity instead of salary (unless it's a startup you believe in)

**Do negotiate:**
- Base salary first
- Then benefits (health, PTO, etc.)
- Then growth opportunities

## Interview Strategy

### How to Handle "Why are you leaving multiple projects?"

**Answer:**
"I've been fortunate to work on diverse projects that have expanded my skills significantly. I've gained experience in trading platforms, fintech, e-commerce, and AI applications. I've worked with Vue.js, React, Next.js, and led teams of different sizes. 

Now I'm looking for a single opportunity where I can:
- Focus deeply on one product/company
- Make a bigger impact with my full attention
- Grow with a team long-term
- Work on challenging problems at scale

I'm ready to commit fully to one role where I can bring all this diverse experience together."

### Key Messages:

1. **Diverse experience = valuable** (not "job hopping")
