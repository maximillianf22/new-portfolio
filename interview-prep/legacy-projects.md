## Strategy: Keep Portfolio Focused

**✅ Current Approach (RECOMMENDED):**
- Keep main portfolio focused on **3-4 most relevant/recent projects**
- Current portfolio shows:
  1. Humancore AI (AI/Next.js - most recent)
  2. Laika Mascotas (E-commerce/Leadership - major impact)
  3. IKATECH Solutions (Legacy migration - technical depth)
  4. Personal Portfolio (Showcase of skills)

**📋 Use Legacy Projects Strategically:**
- **In interviews:** Mention when relevant to show breadth ("I've worked across finance, government, education sectors")
- **In cover letters:** Reference when applying to similar industries
- **As conversation starters:** "I've built systems for [specific industry] before"
- **Keep as reference:** This document for quick recall

**🎯 When to Add Projects:**
- Only add if:
  - They're **recent** (last 2-3 years)
  - They show **different skills** not already demonstrated
  - They're **highly relevant** to the job you're applying for
  - They have **clear impact/story** to tell

---

## Recent Notable Projects (Outside Main Work)

**Question:** What are the "bastantes destacables" projects you've done outside Humancore?

Consider adding 1-2 if they:
- Show different skills/technologies
- Have impressive impact/results
- Are relevant to target roles
- Can be described with clear problem/solution/impact

**Keep portfolio lean and impactful!** 🎯
